# Demo Video Setup

## Instructions

1. **Add your demo video** to this `public` folder with the filename: `demo-video.mp4`

2. **Video Requirements:**
   - Format: MP4
   - Recommended resolution: 1920x1080 (1080p) or 1280x720 (720p)
   - Recommended duration: 2-5 minutes
   - File size: Keep under 50MB for good loading performance

3. **Video Content Suggestions:**
   - Show the app's main features
   - Demonstrate the writing assistance in action
   - Highlight the AI chat and grammar checking
   - Show team collaboration features
   - Display the clean, student-friendly interface

4. **File Structure:**
   ```
   public/
   ├── demo-video.mp4  ← Your video goes here
   ├── favicon.svg
   ├── vite.svg
   └── README-VIDEO.md (this file)
   ```

5. **Testing:**
   - After adding the video, the demo button on the landing page will open your video in a new tab
   - The video will be accessible at: `https://your-domain.com/demo-video.mp4`

## Alternative: Video Modal (Optional Enhancement)

If you'd prefer the video to open in a modal instead of a new tab, let me know and I can implement that feature!
